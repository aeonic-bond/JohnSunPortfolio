I tackled common pain points within Autodesk Revit by streamlining the UX of setting reference planes and assigning parameters. I conducted user research, designed wireframes, built a working MVP demo with AI assistance, and conducted user tests. With one iteration on UI, the final testing round showed a 100% completion rate. These results demonstrate that parametric processes can be intuited in under 5 minutes when built on modern, intuitive design principles."

Revit is the dominant architecture tool and uses the term \"family\" to refer to reusable 3D components. Families are ideally built parametrically, meaning they are systematically generated with variables controlling aspects such as length and width. Creating families in Revit has a steep learning curve due to Revit's outdated UX.\n\nWorking alongside two senior architects, Matthew and Nicky, I set out to improve the UX of family creation. As a team, we settled on exploring this idea by designing and creating a separate browser-based family editor that can export to Revit. In my research of Revit, I identified 3 key frustrations:"

Creating a good parametric family is akin to writing good code. You need a mechanism to store variable data. You need to take that data as input and generate an output. You also want to generally avoid adding unnecessary elements. Just like in code, more cumbersome families mean more bloated projects and slower processing and rendering."

The obvious reason was to allow the user to see all assets being added, which would encourage them to stay organized, knowing that each new asset was being recorded. The second reason was tied to a crucial feature that Matthew and Nicky pushed for. Torus would force objects like reference planes to have strictly enforced parent/child relationships. An Asset Tree would help users visualize the logic behind those relationships significantly better than the 3D environment alone can.\n\nFor the right-side panel, I decided to keep the Parameter Panel visible, communicating that parameters are fundamental to Torus' workflow."

To streamline this particularly common flow, I designed the OffsetEQRP tool to behave similarly to OffsetRP but automatically generate a mirrored RP. Both RPs would be added to an EQ group in the asset panel, and a parameter can be applied to the total distance between them."
